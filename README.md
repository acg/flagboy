## A Salt Lake City Puzzle Game ##

How did the Salt Lake City pedestrian cross the road? Why, with an orange safety flag in hand, of course.

Since 2000 the city has provided buckets of [fluorescent orange flags](http://www.thecvcouncil.com/pedestrian_flag.html) at various street crossings. As a New Yorker I found this amusing enough to write a game about it. :) I was helped by a Salt Lake City native who did the graphics and level design. We threw the whole thing together from scratch in about 4 hours one night, which should set your expectations of quality...appropriately.

## Playing it ##

It's a javascript game. Just open htdocs/index.html in your browser.
